## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this proyect i remembered some things about flexbox, grid, tables, lists, articles and sections.
It didnt took to much efford, but i had to search some topics online to understand and use them, so next time i encounter with similar problems it is easyer to solve them.
.**

### Continued development

I need to learn more about lists and how to style better the dots/numbers
